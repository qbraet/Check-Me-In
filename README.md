# Check Me In

This repo contains the source code of the Check Me In app for Android.
Check Me in is an app that uses Geofencing to determine your location and check you in on Swarm locations of your choice.
I also wanted to try out the [Android Annotations library](https://github.com/excilys/androidannotations)

## Fixes and new features

Improvements and bugfixes by the community will be included in next releases of the app.
