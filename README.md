# Check Me In

This repo contains the source code of the Check Me In app for Android (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=be.quentinbraet.checkmein).
Check Me in is an app that uses Geofencing to determine your location and check you in on Swarm locations of your choice.
I also wanted to try out the Android Annotations library (https://github.com/excilys/androidannotations)

## Fixes and new features

Improvements and bugfixes by the community will be included in next releases of the app.
